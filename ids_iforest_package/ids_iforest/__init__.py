"""Topâ€‘level package for the IDS Isolation Forest project.

This package exposes utilities for capturing network packets, aggregating
them into flows, extracting features and training/using an Isolation
Forest model to detect anomalous network activity.  It also provides a
simple web interface and a combined server that runs the detector and
web UI concurrently.

The public API surface is intentionally minimal; most users will
interact with the package via the console scripts defined in
``pyproject.toml``.
